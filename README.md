# Cave Game
A recreation of Cave Game, the earliest version of Minecraft.

## Features
- Stone and grass nodes.
- Place & destroy them.
- That's about it.

## Notes

Whilst looking like cobble, stone is infact `minecraft:stone`.

Technical names `minecraft:nnn` and `nnn` are aliases to the "modern" Minecraft names.

Select mapgen `singlenode` for a truly flat world.
Mapgen v6 unsupported.
